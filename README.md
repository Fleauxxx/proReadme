# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## My Task

My task was to generate a professional readme file using the command line.
To do so I used Nodejs and the Inquirer package as well as fs.writeFile


## User Story

As a Developer I want to create a generator to produce ready to go professional readme files quickly.
Keeping a readme generator around is kind of a like having a quick template to pull up and start the project.
